# ISS-app

For this project I used the API on https://wheretheiss.at/w/developer which tracks the location of the International Space Station in real-time. Rate limit is 1 per second. I have used a setInterval function which automatically will refresh the page every second.

For implementing the map I have used https://leafletjs.com/ and https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=8/51.283/5.359
